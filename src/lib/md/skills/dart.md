Dart is a programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund and developed by Google. The programming language can be used to develop web and mobile apps as well as server and desktop applications.

Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. It can compile to machine code, JavaScript, or WebAssembly. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics and type inference.
