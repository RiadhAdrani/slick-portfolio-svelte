Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced "view", **which is wrong according to the french language, from which the name is coming**) is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript library for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.
