_JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles._ - [`wikipedia`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

That's impressive and all, but you know what's also impressive ? shooting yourself in the foot while writing some code with this language:

<br/>

```js
'11' + 1; // 111 : fair enough, string concatenation !
'11' - 1; // 10  : why ???
```

<br/>

Jokes aside, I enjoyed learning this weird language, I loved creating interactive websites, from using only `vanilla js`, then `React`, `Vue`, `Angular`, `Svelte`, `Solid`, to creating my own `SPA` framework called [`Recursive`](https://github.com/RiadhAdrani/recursive) inspired by `React` and `Flutter`, which was a real eye-opener and made me skip (to some degree) some learning steps, as I am aware of what really happens internally.

Let's say, I am not your `average javascript developer` ðŸ˜œ.
